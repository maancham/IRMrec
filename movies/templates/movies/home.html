          <p class="card-text" style="text-align: justify;">
            This study consists of three main parts. You can access each part, as well as the study instructions
            (tutorial), from the dropdown menu in the top right corner of the page. The parts are:
            <br>
            <strong>1. Judge Movies:</strong>
            Based on your provided ratings, we will show you movies to judge.
            <br>
            <strong>2. View Judged Movies:</strong>
            At any time, you can review the movies you have already judged in the system. You can modify your judgments
            by clicking on the movie title.
            <br>
            <strong>3. Final Ranking:</strong>
            In the last step, we will ask you to choose your top movies from all the recommendations. Please note that
            this step will only be unlocked once you have judged all the recommended movies.
          </p>
