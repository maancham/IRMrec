                            <p><strong>Question 1: </strong>When judging movies and specifying your interest in watching
                                the movie via a streaming service (Netflix, etc.), what should your interest level
                                correspond to?</p>
                            <input type="radio" name="q1" value="a"> The degree to which you like the movie or
                            anticipate liking the movie, i.e. your rating. <br>
                            <input type="radio" name="q1" value="b"> The likely order that you'd watch the movies, i.e.
                            you want to watch the movies you are more interested in before the movies you are less
                            interested in.<br>

                            <br>

                            <p><strong>Question 2: </strong>When judging movies and specifying your interest in watching
                                movies via a streaming service (Netflix, etc.), can you be interested in watching
                                movies that you've already seen?</p>
                            <input type="radio" name="q2" value="a"> Yes. We all know the joy of finding a favorite
                            movie available on a streaming service and wanting to watch it again.<br>
                            <input type="radio" name="q2" value="b"> No. If you've already seen a movie, you should not
                            be interested in watching it again.<br>

                            <br>

                            <p><strong>Question 3: </strong>When judging a movie and specifying your interest in
                                watching a movie via a streaming service (Netflix, etc.), you have seen the movie
                                previously and rated it 5 stars, the highest rating possible, can you be uninterested in
                                watching it again?</p>
                            <input type="radio" name="q3" value="a"> Yes. It is possible to love a movie but not be
                            interested in watching it again. <br>
                            <input type="radio" name="q3" value="b"> No. If you love a movie, you must be interested in
                            watching it again very soon.<br>

                            <br>

                            <p><strong>Question 4: </strong>When judging movies, for the movies you've already seen,
                                what is the rating scale that you will use?</p>
                            <input type="radio" name="q4" value="a"> The Movielens rating scale of 0.5 to 5 stars, and
                            I should rate the movies the same as if I was rating them on Movielens.<br>
                            <input type="radio" name="q4" value="b"> On a scale of 0 to 100 where scores over 50 are
                            for
                            movies I like and scores less than 50 are for movies that I dislike.<br>
                            <input type="radio" name="q4" value="c"> There is not a rating scale. I am supposed to
                            describe in words my opinion of the movie.<br>

                            <br>

                            <p><strong>Question 5: </strong>For a movie you have not yet seen (an unseen movie), what
                                are the possible judgments?</p>
                            <input type="radio" name="q5" value="a"> 1. Never heard of it. 2. Familiar with it. 3. Very
                            familiar with it.<br>
                            <input type="radio" name="q5" value="b"> 1. Inappropriate or bad recommendation. 2. Okay
                            recommendation. 3. Good recommendation.<br>
                            <input type="radio" name="q5" value="c"> None of the above.<br>

                            <br>

                            <p><strong>Question 6: </strong>For an unseen movie, we will ask you to predict what your
                                Movielens rating would be for the movie after you watch it. Is this the same as your
                                interest in watching the movie?</p>
                            <input type="radio" name="q6" value="a"> Yes. The higher your predicted rating, the more
                            interested you are in watching the movie.<br>
                            <input type="radio" name="q6" value="b"> No. Your predicted rating is based on how much you
                            think you'll like the movie, but your "interest in watching" level is based on your true
                            desire of what order you want to watch movies in.<br>


                            <br>


                            <p><strong>Question 7: </strong>How can you view the list of movies you've already judged
                                during the judgment phase?</p>
                            <input type="radio" name="q7" value="a"> It is not possible<br>
                            <input type="radio" name="q7" value="b"> Refresh the homepage<br>
                            <input type="radio" name="q7" value="c"> Click on the corresponding option in the top-right

                            <br>

                            <p><strong>Question 8: </strong>How can you make edits to your answers for a movie you have
                                already judged?
                            </p>

                            set of answers for that specific movie<br>
                            <input type="radio" name="q8" value="b"> By clicking on the movie title available on the

                            <br>

                            <p><strong>Question 9: </strong>Where can you find the number of remaining movies to be
                                judged?
                            </p>

                            <br>

                                judgment tasks?</p>
                            <input type="radio" name="q10" value="a"> You can't as it will become available once all
                            movies have been judged<br>
